// Solutions for uncommon Express.js errors:

//Unexpected token error solution:
//Carefully review your code for syntax errors. Use a linter to help catch these. Make sure all modules are correctly imported and that they don't have any errors themselves.

//Callback hell solution:
//Use async/await or promises to avoid nesting many callbacks. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read and debug.

//Memory leak solution:
//Use tools like heap snapshots to identify objects that are not being garbage collected. Correct any coding practices that lead to these leaks, ensuring that you are releasing unnecessary references. Close any open connections and streams when they are no longer needed.
